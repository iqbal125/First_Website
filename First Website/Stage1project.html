    <h1> Choosing a Boxing Glove </h1>
      <p><b>In this article we will rank various boxing gloves based on quality.</b></p>
  </div>
  <div class="list">
        <h2  class="title"><b>Beginner Gloves Price Range: $20-50</b></h2>
        <ol>
          <li img src="http://media.everlast.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/280x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/r/pro-style-training-gloves_5.jpg" alt="image not found"/></li>
          <li><span style="color:#4dffa6">Century:</span> Cheapest Boxing glove not very functional and offers minimal hand protection.</li>
          <li><span style="color:#4dffa6">Everlast:</span> More of a toy than a real glove, good for kids or girls.</li>
          <li><span style="color:#4dffa6">Title Classic:</span> Value brand, very good products for the price. The quality is not top notch however.</li>
          <li><span style="color:#4dffa6">Misc. Glove brands:</span> These are gloves produced by companies
            that dont primarily sell boxing equipment, such as Revgear, Adidas, Combat sports, Nike, etc.
             These gloves are mostly about aesthetics and severely overpriced. </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="list">
        <h2 class="title"><b>Intermediate Gloves: $65-110</b></h2>
        <ol start="5">
          <li><span style="color:#4dffa6">Windy, Fairtex, Twins, Top King etc.:</span> All Thai brands, Hand made gloves with excellent quality.
            They are all more of a Muay Thai kickboxing glove than a traditional boxing glove. Most widely used gloves in Asia.</li>
          <li><span style="color:#4dffa6">Rivals:</span>Canadian brand, Top notch quality with cool aesthetics, for people who care about looks and cool designs on boxing gloves. Reviewers of the gloves often complain about the wrist strap system however.</li>
          <li><span style="color:#4dffa6">Fighting Sports, Title Platinum:</span> Title's premium line of gloves. Good overall gloves.
            These gloves are top notch quality, but they are not as good as Ringside.
            They are slightly less expensive than Ringside as well.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="list">
     <h2 class="title"><b>High End Professional Gloves: $120-200</b></h2>
      <ol start="8">
        <li><span style="color:#4dffa6">Hayabusa:</span> Japanese brand, from personal experience these are outstanding gloves.
          The wrist protection is unmatched by any glove at any price range.
           These are extremely high quality at a higher price.</li>
        <li><span style="color:#4dffa6"> Ringside, Lonsdale:</span> Widely considered the best brands for serious fighters. Top notch quality at a higher price, you get what you pay for.</li>
        <li><span style="color:#4dffa6"> Cleto Reyes, Grant:</span>Both Brands are hand made in Mexico using only the best leather, these gloves are what Mike Tyson, Manny Pacquiao, Floyd Mayweather and Bernard Hopkins wear in the ring.
          These are actual gloves professional fighters wear in the ring for $50 million pay-per view fights. Not recommended for training outside the ring though</li>
      </ol>
